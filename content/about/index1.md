The educational path that I have followed up to my Bachelor's degree from [COMSATS University Islamabad]('https://www.comsats.edu.pk/') has led me to switch from Science to Commerce backgrounds in my ['O' and 'A' Level] education respectively and shift cities from Quetta to Karachi. Finally, reaching COMSATS Islamabad campus in 2014 to pursue Computer Science made me realize that having a non-technical background is a plus as although being the odd one out. It had its share of pros and cons but overall I take it as a big plus as it was and still is my strength while climbing the different steps of University life and practical life currently, as they say. As is the case with Artificial Intelligence, a person has to wear multiple hats from various domains to make it work for both oneself and the organization.

Currently, I'm currently working as a data visualizer on Power BI for EY Ford Rhodes in Islamabad, Pakistan. To date I have developed nine dashboards for different kind of procurements made by the KPK provincial government.
